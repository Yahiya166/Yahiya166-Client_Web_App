                                        adding a photo to matrimonial profile tremendously increases the number of times
                                        your profile is viewed by upto 6 or 7 fold. This in turn increases 8 fold your
                                        chances to receive as many responses if you attach a photo. By uploading your
                                        best photos, along with any specific details you wish to add in order to make
                                        your profile impressive, and attract better responses. You must add more than
